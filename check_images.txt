Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The three model architectures did not classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same. ResNet identified it as a Labrador Retriever, AlexNet as a German Shepherd, and VGG as a Beagle.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the architectures classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed. ResNet identified Dog_02.jpg as a Golden Retriever, AlexNet as a Dachshund, and VGG as a Siberian Husky.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:  ResNet and AlexNet correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as non-dogs, but VGG misclassified Animal_Name_01.jpg as a Pembroke.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:Considering the overall performance in breed classification and correctly identifying non-dogs, ResNet appears to be the best model architecture. It provided accurate breed predictions for both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg and correctly identified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as non-dogs.
